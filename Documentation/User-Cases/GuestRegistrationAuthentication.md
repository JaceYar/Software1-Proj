| Extensions | [4]a. **Invalid Data Format**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4]a1 The system highlights the specific field (e.g., "Invalid Credit Card Format")<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4]a2 The guest corrects the data<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4]a3 Continue from step 4<br>[5]a. **Email Already Exists**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[5]a1 The system notifies the guest that an account already exists with that email<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[5]a2 The system offers a "Forgot Password" or "Login" link<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[5]a3 Use case ends<br>[7]a. **Authentication Failure**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[7]a1 The system creates the account but fails the initial login<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[7]a2 The system redirects the guest to the manual Login page |
| Special Reqs | ● PCI Compliance: Credit card data must be handled according to security standards (e.g., masking numbers in the UI)<br>● Data Integrity: The "Welcome" message must dynamically pull the FirstName attribute from the database<br>● Persistence: Guest information must remain accessible for future "Store" purchases without re-entry |
