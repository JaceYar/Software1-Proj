# User Story: Guest Registration & Authentication

**As a** guest,
**I want to** register an account with my personal and payment information,
**so that** I can log in and use hotel services such as booking rooms and purchasing from the store.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. I can select a "Register" or "Create Account" option from the portal.
2. I can enter my personal details (Full Name, Address, Email, Password) and payment details (Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, CVV).
3. The system validates the format of all fields (e.g., email syntax, credit card Luhn algorithm) and highlights any invalid fields.
4. If my email is already registered, the system notifies me and offers a "Forgot Password" or "Login" link.
5. Upon successful registration, I am automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard with a "Welcome [Name]" message.
6. My payment information is securely tokenized and stored for future purchases without re-entry.
