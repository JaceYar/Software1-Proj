# User Story: Process Check-In

**As a** hotel clerk,
**I want to** check in a guest with an existing reservation,
**so that** the guest is assigned a room and can begin their stay.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. I can search for a guest's reservation by name or confirmation number.
2. The system displays the reservation details so I can verify them with the guest.
3. The system shows available rooms that match the reservation criteria.
4. I can select a specific room to assign to the guest.
5. The system updates the room status to occupied and records the check-in timestamp.
6. If no matching rooms are available, I can offer the guest an upgrade or alternative room.
7. If the reservation is not found, I can create a new reservation for the guest.
8. After check-in, the guest can access hotel services including the store.
