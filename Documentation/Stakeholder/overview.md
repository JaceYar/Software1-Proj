[**Project Problem Description**](https://baylor.instructure.com/courses/245021/pages/group-project-problem-statement "Group Project - Problem Statement") 

**The project** is expected to be a Java SE system providing input/output functionality. Students are allowed to use libraries and other JARs, it must be Maven-based, tested with JUnit tests, and use Git (GitHub or GitLab) from the beginning. It will use the User Interface (Swing).  It will be documented involving the UML class model, sequence diagrams, and use case modeling artifacts. Moreover, the project must demonstrate the use of good coding practice, which includes some meaningful level of comments in JavaDoc. Your project should be linked with an issue tracking/ticketing system as well. More details will be specified later in the semester. While it is stated as a small project, it is considered from a professional perspective; please do not underestimate it since it will take at least half of the semester to build it.

There will be **three iterations** of the project, and each iteration should be presented to me,

-   analysis outcomes
-   design outcomes, with implementation prototype
-   implementation outcomes

IMPORTANT: Each member should be in charge of at least **3 use cases for their full analysis, design, and implementation/unit testing.**

**Iteration 1 - Week 5:**

The project vision, requirements (user stories in Trello accepted), use cases with business constraints, Use Case diagram, Domain model, SSDs, system operations with operation contracts, design class diagram, [wireframes Links to an external site.](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/), each of the members will implement three non-basic use cases and related SSD and other artifacts (also implement them in the project)

presentation of **iteration 1** (project - analysis, User Interface sketches, domain model, SSD, operations, requirements, use cases, keep zip for iteration 1 on the website) **\[10min\]** 

Include in your presentation all issues in your ticketing system (open, resolved), the number of commits, and the roster of hours worked by each member, including Trello history

**Iteration 2 - Week 10:**

Sequence diagrams, design model, package diagram and architecture, Demo of the current prototype, identification of GRASP patterns, the revised analysis

presentation of **iteration 2** (project - implementation, testing, maven, git, GUI, prototype, all relevant diagrams, keep zip for iteration 2 on the website) **\[10min\]** 

Include in your presentation all issues in your ticketing system (open, resolved), the number of commits, and hours worked by each member 

**Iteration 3 - Week 15:**

Persistence (storage), Business layer, Testing + Logging described and implemented, UI, User Guide, revised design and analysis, three use cases each member – recorded as a video.

presentation of **iteration 3** (project - implementation, maven, git, GUI, prototype, testing, all diagrams due on the website) **\[10min\]**

-   The last presentation needs to have a video showing **3 use cases per member** for acceptance testing posted on your website
-   I do want to see your implementation and functionality, show me what you are selling.

Include in your presentation all issues in your ticketing system (open, resolved), the number of commits, and hours worked by each member 

**Deliverable**: For each presentation, you should submit a single PDF document with documentation and models, one zip with software.

**The project** is expected to be a 3-layered application with Java SE. The data models must contain at least seven data entities /concepts with one-to-many and many-to-many association mapping. Moreover, the project must demonstrate the use of JUnit tests, git, JavaDoc, polymorphism, and Maven.

**User Interface (Swing vs. Web Bonus)**

The core project is a **Java SE** application and the expected GUI technology is **Swing** (as specified above). The primary goal is to practice the **software engineering process and SDLC artifacts** (requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and testing), rather than to train on a particular UI framework. **Optional bonus (2 points)**: teams may implement an additional **web-based UI** (e.g., HTML/CSS with a minimal integration layer) as an extension, but the **core grading and documentation expectations remain anchored on the Java-based system design and engineering artifacts**.

**Project documentation**. The deliverable must be thoroughly tested with good code practice (formatting, commenting) using Maven, Git, and linking the ticketing system. Deliverable is a link to the GIT repository. The complete documentation (single file) covering the abstract, the background story for introduction, requirements, analysis, design, implementation, evaluation/testing, and the conclusion must be a SINGLE PDF (not multiple). Each section must use appropriate UML diagrams in vector graphics (EPS/PDF) properly labeled and referenced. Citations must be made when referencing technology. Create a User Manual, the **roster of hours per team member, list of git contributions, link to Issue tracking.** 

The last presentation needs to have a video; I do want to see your implementation and functionality; show me what you are selling, and justify the quality assurance process you took.

**Project iterations** (each includes a presentation, printout, and the identical version on the web with links to the latest runnable version):

Iteration 1 (4 points)

Analysis: project vision (what is it about), team members, website, git link, issue tracking link, requirements (functional and non-functional), fully dressed use cases (I only want these in the course), traceability matrix, system sequence diagrams, user interface wireframes, teamwork plan, domain model, actors. Each student has three use cases to cover for the entire project (including implementation). \- presentation and single project PDF document suggested point redistribution among team members, timecards report for each team member.

Iteration 2 (5 points)

Initial DEMO of User Interface using Maven, Design diagrams (e.g., Design Class diagram, Sequence/Communication diagrams - 3 per each team member, package diagram if suitable). GRASP - justify why system operation in a given class, Test coverage plan, Updated project plan (Gantt), Linked issue tracking system and git, revised iteration 1, suggested point redistribution, timecards report. **Documentation will be delivered as a single PDF file. The revised iteration 1 should be a separate PDF document.**

Iteration 3 (6 points)

Complete application with User Interface and user input validation, tests, user guide, live demonstration, video of all use cases by each member, results from git analysis (how many commits, each member commits), time tracking with suggested point redistribution, code documentation (JavaDoc), runnable as a JAR, timecards report. **Documentation will be delivered as a single PDF file. The revised iteration 2 should be a separate PDF document.**

**AI-Assisted Development Policy**

In the group project, responsible use of AI-assisted tools (e.g., Copilot / Claude / Cursor) is **allowed and encouraged** to reduce low-level coding overhead and help teams focus more on **analysis, design, documentation, and iteration**. However, your team remains fully responsible for correctness, consistency between documentation/code/demo, and the ability to explain design decisions. Please follow the course policy: **“[Acceptable vs. Unacceptable AI Use in the Project](https://baylor.instructure.com/courses/245021/pages/acceptable-vs-unacceptable-ai-use-in-the-group-project "Acceptable vs. Unacceptable AI Use in the Group Project")”** (see the linked page for requirements and examples).
